# NASA Rover Images

- The site is not responsive. It is designed for _desktop_ only.
- I have optimized the `upload.svg` file and used it as an inline svg with Tailwind css. This allowed me to style it with css, instead of using javascript.
- I have not implemented any tests. There wasn't enough time to do so.
- The given design does not specify what to do when the user drags & drops an image. I have added a simple button to simulate the post request.
- Overall I was a bit confused with the requirements. I was unclear about which aspects we needed to alter and which ones were supposed to remain unchanged.
